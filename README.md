## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.13.2 or later
- pipx (recommended for isolated installation)

### Installation Steps

1. **Using pipx:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/woodyk/echoai.git
cd echoai
pipx install .
```

2. **Using pip:**
```bash
pip install echoai
```

### API Key Configuration
EchoAI supports multiple AI providers including ollama. Set up your API keys as environment variables:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
export NVIDIA_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
export MISTRAL_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
export GROK_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

For persistent configuration, add these exports to your shell's rc file (e.g., ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc).

## Usage

To run the application after installation, simply execute:

```bash
echoai
```
or
```bash
ai
```

To run the application directly from the cloned github repository.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install .
python -m echoai.main
```

### Commands

Once the application is running, you can use the following command to show the available slash commands:

- `/help`: Displays available commands.

### Configuration

EchoAI allows for customization via a configuration file located at `~/.echoai`. The configuration includes:

- `model`: The AI model to use (default: `openai:gpt-4o`).
- `system_prompt`: The system prompt for the AI assistant.
- `username`: The username displayed in the application.
- `markdown`: Boolean to determine if markdown should be used for output.
- `theme`: Current theme of the application.
- `tools`: Whether tools are available for use.

Changes to settings can be made via the `/settings` command.

## Dependencies

### Required Dependencies
- Python 3.13.2 or later
- Core Libraries:
  - `rich`: Terminal formatting and styling
  - `prompt_toolkit`: Interactive command-line interface
  - `openai`: OpenAI API client
  - `ollama`: Ollama API client
  - `python-magic`: File type detection
  - `PyPDF2`: PDF document processing
  - `python-docx`: Word document processing
  - `pandas`: Data analysis (optional for some features)

### Optional Dependencies

## Pluggable LLM Tool Sets

Tool call plugins are located in the `echoai/tools` directory. To add a new tool:

- Place your Python script in `echoai/tools`.
- All **top-level functions** (excluding those prefixed with `_`) are auto-imported.
- **Nested functions** and those starting with `_` are ignored.
- Keep tools **simple and self-contained**â€”ideally, one function per tool.
- Use **type hints** and a clear **docstring**. These are required for LLM auto-discovery and instruction parsing.

### Example Tool

```python
from typing import Dict

def read_file(path: str) -> Dict[str, str]:
    """
    Reads a file and returns its content or an error message.

    Parameters:
        path (str): File path.

    Returns:
        Dict[str, str]: {
            "status": "success" or "error",
            "content": file content or error message
        }
    """
    try:
        with open(path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
            content = file.read()
        return {"status": "success", "content": content}
    except Exception as e:
        return {"status": "error", "content": str(e)}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **API Key Not Found:**
   - Ensure API keys are properly exported in your environment
   - Verify the keys are added to your shell's rc file if using persistent configuration

2. **Installation Errors:**
   - Ensure you have Python 3.13.2 or later
   - Try using `pipx install --force .` if encountering dependency conflicts

3. **File Analysis Issues:**
   - Verify file permissions
   - Ensure required libraries (PyPDF2, python-docx) are installed

4. **Theme or Display Issues:**
   - Try resetting to default theme with `/theme default`
   - Ensure your terminal supports ANSI color codes
